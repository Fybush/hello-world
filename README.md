# hello-world
Newbie just starting out with github
Trying to make sense of it all

So, I create a new branch off of the main branch, then make edits to the files as needed.
Does the creation of e new branch involve a 'pull' request? I imagine it would have to 
in order to get the current files in the main branch.
Then, modify the files as required and 'commit' the changes. These changes are committed to the new branch
that was created. At this point, the two branches would be different.
